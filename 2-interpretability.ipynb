    "Recipe `1-engine-intro.ipynb` provides a basic introduction into the Howso Engine \n",
    "workflow. The Trainee built in that notebook allows us to make a prediction for an unseen test dataset, however the raw prediction may not be fully informative. After building and training a Trainee, a user will want to explore how different features affect the Trainee and its predictions. In this notebook we will explore information that can be extracted from the Howso Engine Trainee. Howso Engine's interpretability tools allow users to understand why predictions were made, evaluate the data that contributed to the predictions, and see similar cases to the predictions. These Howso Engine interpretability capabilities will be demonstrated in this notebook:\n",

    "Howso Engine's power is in its interpretability. In recipe `1-engine-intro.ipynb`, we compared a traditional machine learning (ML) workflow using `Scikit-Learn` Logistic Regression with the Howso Engine workflow to illustrate a typical ML modeling prediction workflow. Moving forward, we will discontinue the use of `Scikit-Learn` Logistic Regression as nearly all of the interpretability functionality that will be demonstrated is Howso Engine-specific. "

    "We can see that `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` generally lie between the 4th and 8th more relevant features according to `feature_contributions`. While this shows that these two features are important in the Trainee and that our unusual feature values may still be concerning, they are still noticeably less important that the top 4 most important features. Intuitively, we expected a feature like `hours-per-week` to have a large impact on our prediction, however these results indicate that it may not have the strong effect we expected. This starts to give us more confidence in the results, as it is likely the most relevant features have values much more in line with someone who makes less than $50k. For example the person is 29 years old, which is quite young in this dataset. It is likely this young age had a large impact in the prediction as age is a strong contributor to the prediction of salary according to these results."

If this value is nominally coded, a high value such as 99999 may not actually correspond to high capital gains. Overall, this indicates that we may need to investigate `capital-gains` further to determine its validitiy in this dataset. However, in the context of this prediction, these high values may not be unusual for people making under $50k. We also see a case with relatively high hours per week similar to our case. We can feel more confident in the prediction results after seeing that there are other people making under $50k with such high values of `capital-gains` and `hours-per-week`."

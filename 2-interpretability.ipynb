    "workflow. The Trainee built in that notebook allows us to make a prediction for an unseen test dataset, however the raw prediction may not be fully informative. After building and training a Trainee, a user will want to explore how different features affect the Trainee and its predictions. In this notebook we will explore information that can be extracted from the Howso Engine Trainee. Howso Engine's interpretability tools allow users to understand why predictions were made, evaluate the data that contributed to the predictions, and see similar cases to the predictions. These Howso Engine interpretability capabilities will be demonstrated in this notebook:\n",

    "Howso Engine's power is in its interpretability. In recipe `1-engine-intro.ipynb`, we compared a traditional machine learning (ML) workflow using `Scikit-Learn` Logistic Regression with the Howso Engine workflow to illustrate a typical ML modeling prediction workflow. Moving forward, we will discontinue the use of `Scikit-Learn` Logistic Regression as nearly all of the interpretability functionality that will be demonstrated is Howso Engine-specific. "

We create a case where a person makes less than $50k, but set two columns `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` to values at the extreme ends of their ranges in the dataset. Without knowing too much about the results, a logical hypothesis from the user would be that a person who has high capital gains and works a very high number of hours will likely earn over $50k, making the case unusual."

First, we want to confirm our suspicions thats these values are not typical by looking at `Feature Residuals`. Feature Residuals are calculated by holding out each individual feature, and then using the rest of the features to predict that feature. This is similiar to the leave-one-out validation technique used in machine learning. The results represent the Trainee's uncertainty for that feature.

    "We can see that `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` show high local residuals compared the global residuals, indicating that these features for our case have high uncertainty. This tells us that the values of these two columns are unusual compared to the rest of the features and further supports our concern about this person being predicted to earn under $50k. In lay terms, when the rest of the features are used to predict these two features and the prediction is inaccurate, i.e., has higher residuals, then these two features uncertain because they are not what the model typically expects given the values of the other features."

    "**`Robust Feature Contribution`:** The difference between the predicted Action Feature value(s) when each feature is included in the Trainee versus not included in the Trainee over a sampling of the power set of all of the Context features. This is closely related to the commonly used `SHAP` feature importance measure. The difference is that SHAP is an exact value for a model (which itself is an approximation) whereas Robust Feature Contribution is an approximation of the feature importance for the relationships expressed in the data."

    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` generally lie between the 4th and 8th more relevant features according to `feature_contributions`. While this shows that these two features are important in the Trainee and that our unusual feature values may still be concerning, they are still noticeably less important that the top 4 most important features. Intuitively, we expected a feature like `hours-per-week` to have a large impact on our prediction, however these results indicate that it may not have the strong effect we expected. This starts to give us more confidence in the results, as it is likely the most relevant features have values much more in line with someone who makes less than $50k. For example the person is 29 years old, which is quite young in this dataset. It is likely this young age had a large impact in the prediction as age is a strong contributor to the prediction of salary according to these results."

    "Looking at these results, we can see several patterns. We learn that `capital-gains` is 99999 for all of the influential cases, indicating a possible error or the use of nominal coding. If this value is nominally coded, a high value such as 99999 may not actually correspond to high capital gains. Overall, this indicates that we may need to investigate `capital-gains` further to determine its validitiy in this dataset. However, in the context of this prediction, these high values may not be unusual for people making under $50k. We also see a case with relatively high hours per week similar to our case. We can feel more confident in the prediction results after seeing that there are other people making under $50k with such high values of `capital-gains` and `hours-per-week`."

Since Local Case Feature Residual Conviction is a ratio, the scale of the results can be interpreted.

Howso Engine Example
=========================

An example to showcase the rich explanations from the Howso client.

Howso Engine allows Python users to access Howso's full functionality
with a user friendly API.

Below is an example use of the `howso.engine.Trainee` class. The
example covers the basic steps in a typical Howso workflow:

1. Creation of a trainee.
2. Training.
3. Analyze the trainee.
4. Reaction by the trainee to new data, which produces predicted values for the action features.
5. Extraction of audit data that explains the prediction.

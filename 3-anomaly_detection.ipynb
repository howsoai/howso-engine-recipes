    "# Recipe 3: Anomaly Detection\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous recipe, `2-interpretability.ipynb` we demonstrated some of the core interpretability capabilities and tools available in Howso Engine. In this recipe, we will use some of those methods to demonstrate a common use case, anomaly detection. Howso Engine  can be used to identify anomalous Cases in a dataset and also explain why cases those may be anomalous. Furthermore, we can leverage other tools we learned in previous recipes, such influential and boundary Cases, to provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding anomalous cases has value in both modeling building and data exploration. For example, as we continue to build a suitable model for the `Adult` datset, detecting anomalies can give us insight into whether we need to clean the dataset to reduce false signals. Possible sources of anomalies could be Cases that are erroneous or falsified.   \n"

    "\n",
    "We will use `Familiarity Conviction` and `Distance Contribution` to identify potentially anomalous cases.`Familiarity Conviction` is metric for describing surprisal of individual Cases in the Trainee relative to other Cases. In other words, Familiarity Conviction evaluates each data point in the Trainee and assigns a surprisal score indicating how similar or different each point is to the remainder of the data. Howso Engine’s interpretability tools also enable us to understand why these cases may be anomalous and whether they are outliers and inliers. \n",

    "**`Familiarity Conviction`:** How confident or familiar the Trainee is about some data point on which it has been trained, as determined by the KL Divergence of the effect of the particular data point on the probability density function of the overall data. The lower the Familiarity Conviction value, the less familiar the Trainee is with the data point. Thus, a Familiarity Conviction of 0.01 corresponds to the Trainee believing a data point is unusual, while a Familiarity Conviction of 2 corresponds to the Trainee believing a data point is fairly familiar. Low values can also be used to determine when further training is needed to improve the Trainee’s ability to provide accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example is if there is a dataset that comprises four data points, such as the corners of a square on a grid. A new data point that lies inside the square, will return high `Familiarity Conviction` (low surprisal) as it fits within the data scheme. However, another data point that lies diagonally from the uppermost corner will have a low `Familiarity Conviction` (high surprisal) because it does not fit in the square, like the other points.\n",

    "This chart is viewed similarly to the outliers chart, however we are now examining Cases that are too similar. We can see that for several Cases, there are a few features that show high `feature_residual_conviction`, indicating that that feature can very easily predicted using the other features. However, this could also just be an indicator of high correlation between certain variables. In our Cases, we do not see a strong case of high `feature_residual_conviction` across a majority of features, thus it is likely that these points are not inliers. In many cases, especially with well known datasets like `Adult`, true inliers are rare as they are often the result of purposeful actions, while outliers may exist more naturally."

    "# Recipe 4: Auditing and Editing\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Howso Engine's instance-based machine learning approach enables unique capabilities in addition to interpretability, which we learned about in the previous recipes. We were able to detect possible anomalies and investigate Influential Cases and features that may be of concern. Using that information combined with Howso Engine giving us dynamic control over our Trainee, we can take meaningful action without having to dramatically incur additional expenses of retrain the Trainee. This is in contrast to most machine learning models which, once trained, are difficult to update without retraining the entire model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate the editability of a Howso Engine Trainee to take advantage of the Trainee and data diagnostic results shown from the `2-interpretability.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done on a small scale where we show how a Case can be edited or removed to modify the behavior of the Trainee. A  Howso Engine Session allows us to toggle entire batches of training data and add/remove large chunks of training data. This can be very useful if we are continously adding data to our Trainee and we discover that certain batches are undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Howso Engine Session\n",
    "\n",
    "A Trainee Session is associated with each modification to a Trainee, which is useful for auditability. A Session consists of the following information:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique identifier  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The user for which the Session was created  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Date the Session was created \n",
    "\n",
    "- Name, given by the user (Optional) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata for the user to store information (Optional) \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Trainees, a default Session will be automatically started for you unless you explicitly start (or create) your own. This Session will be used for all interactions with the Trainee, unless a new Session is explicitly started, for as long as your Client is running. Additionally, each instance of a Howso Client will use its own unique active Session. Starting a new Session explicitly is useful if you want to give it a name and/or metadata for your own reference later, or if you wish to use separate Sessions for different modifications of the Trainee. For example, using a unique Session each time you train would allow you to later reference the specific cases that were trained by a certain Session. \n",

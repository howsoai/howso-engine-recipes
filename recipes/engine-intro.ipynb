    " \n",
    "Howso Engine is a generalized Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence platform that creates powerful decision-making platforms that are fully explainable, auditable, and editable. Howso Engine uses Instance-Based Machine Learning which stores instances, i.e., data points, in memory and makes predictions about new instances given their relationship to existing instances. This technology harnesses a fast spatial query system and techniques from information theory to enhance both performance and accuracy. \n",

This is why, for example, the min and max bounds on continuous features are not the exact min and max values of the dataset, but rather an expanded version of those min and max values to allow for some variation. However, users are encouraged to manually adjust feature attributes such as bounds if the properties of any features in the data are well defined.\n",

    "Howso Engine provide users with powerful tools to perform a variety of data analysis and prediction tasks. However, making predictions may not suffice if these tools are used for decision-making. As an example with this specific `Adult` dataset, if the user were a bank predicting whether an individual will make over or under $50k in the future for loan decisions, the outcome of prediction efforts might adversely affect the livelihood of that individual as well as the bank if the prediction is inaccurate or biased. Ideally, a predictive tool should provide both accurate results and interpretability so that it can be held accountable for its predictions. Unfortunately, traditional ML techniques often leave a lot to be desired in terms of interpretability. Because of its instance-based ML nature, Howso Engine is inherently interpretable."

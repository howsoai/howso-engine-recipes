    "workflow. In that notebook, we inspect model accuracy, but we don't investigate how the model makes its predictions. After building and training a Trainee, a user will want to explore how different features affect the Trainee and its predictions. In this notebook we will explore information that can be extracted from a Trainee. Howso Engine's interpretability tools allow users to understand why predictions were made, evaluate the data that contributed to the predictions, and learn which features are most impactful to the prediction. These Howso Engine interpretability capabilities will be demonstrated in this notebook:\n",

We create a case where a person makes less than $50k, but set two columns `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` to values at the extreme ends of their ranges in the dataset. Without knowing too much about the results, a logical hypothesis from the user would be that a person who has high capital gains and works a very high number of hours will likely earn over $50k, making the case unusual."

First, we want to confirm our suspicions that these values are not typical by looking at `Feature Residuals`. Feature Residuals are the mean absolute error between predicted and true values for each feature. They are calculated by holding out each individual feature, and then using the rest of the features to predict that feature. This is similiar to the leave-one-out validation technique used in machine learning. The results represent the Trainee's uncertainty for that feature. We will use the `Local Feature Residuals` to examine the uncertainty for region of data around this case and the `Global Feature Residual` as a baseline as they represent the residual across the entire trained model.\n",

    "We can see that `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` show high local residuals when compared to the global residuals, indicating that these features for our case have high uncertainty. This tells us that these two features are particularly noisy in this region of the data. In lay terms, when the rest of the features are used to predict these two features and the predictions are inaccurate, i.e., has higher residuals, then these two features are uncertain because they are not what the model expects given the values of the other features."

    "Now that we see these features are a bit unusual, we can determine how important they are. One metric that allows a user to gain insight into feature importance is Howso Engine's Feature Contribution. Feature Contribution gives the user insight into the magnitude of a feature's effect on the predicted outcome, regardless of accuracy.\n",

    "**`Feature Contribution`:** The difference between the predicted Action Feature value when a feature is used as a Context Feature and the predicted value when it is not used (all other Context Features are used). Feature Contribution units are on the same scale as the Action Feature(s), and will be probabilities for categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Robust Feature Contribution`:** The difference between the predicted Action Feature value(s) when each feature is used as a Context Feature and the predicted value when it is not used with the remaining Context features being a sampling of the power set of all of the Context features. This is closely related to the commonly used `SHAP` feature importance measure. The difference is that SHAP is an exact value for a model (which itself is an approximation) whereas Robust Feature Contribution is an approximation of the feature importance for the relationships expressed in the data."

    "We can see that `capital-gain` and `hours-per-week` generally lie between the 4th and 8th most relevant features according to `feature_contributions`. While this shows that these two features are important in the Trainee and that our unusual feature values may still be concerning, they are still noticeably less important that the top 4 most important features. Intuitively, we expected a feature like `hours-per-week` to have a large impact on our prediction, however these results indicate that it may not have the strong effect we expected. This starts to give us more confidence in the results, as it is likely the most relevant features have values much more in line with someone who makes less than $50k. For example the person is 29 years old, which is quite young in this dataset. It is likely this young age had a large impact in the prediction as age is a strong contributor to the prediction of salary according to these results."

    "Looking at these results, we can see several patterns. We learn that `capital-gains` is 99999 for many of the influential cases, indicating a possible error or the use of nominal coding. If this value is nominally coded, a high value such as 99999 may not actually correspond to high capital gains. Overall, this indicates that we may need to investigate `capital-gains` further to determine its validitiy in this dataset. However, in the context of this prediction, these high values may not be unusual for people making under $50k. We also see a case with relatively high hours per week similar to our case. We can feel more confident in the prediction results after seeing that there are other people making under $50k with such high values of `capital-gains` and `hours-per-week`."

This value is calculated by dividing the error between the a feature value and the predicted value for a case from the local residual for that feature.

Since Local Case Feature Residual Conviction is a ratio, conviction values across different features can be compared on the same scale regardless of the scale of the feature. Convictions of 0.01 corresponds to very low certainty predictions and could be considered to be a guess, while a higher Conviction, such as 2, corresponds to a confident prediction.\n",

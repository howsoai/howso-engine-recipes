    "In the recipe, `engine-insights.ipynb`, we demonstrated an introduction to anomaly detection. In this recipe, expand on the methods used in that recipe. Howso Engine can be used to identify anomalous cases in a dataset and also explain why those cases may be anomalous. Furthermore, we can leverage other tools we learned in previous recipes, such  as influential and boundary cases, to provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding anomalous cases has value in both model building and data exploration. For example, as we continue to build a suitable model for the `Adult` datset, detecting anomalies can give us insight into whether we need to clean the dataset to reduce false signals. Possible sources of anomalies could be cases that are erroneous or falsified.   \n"

Conviction is a value indicating how surprising a case is relative to how surprising other cases in the model are. In the case of `Familiarity Conviction`, the level of surprisal is measured by the perturbation of the probability distribution when the case is added or removed (hence the parameters: `familiarity_conviction_addition` and `familiarity_conviction_removal`).

    "From the above results, we can see which cases may be anomalous, however just knowing whether a case is potentially an anomaly doesn't give us all the information we need to make an informed decision. If we are deciding whether to prune a case from our training set, often we only want to prune erroneous values. Even if a case is an anomaly in terms of distance or value, if it is valid we may still leave it in as it represents a legitimate data point. \n",

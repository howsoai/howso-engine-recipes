These prediction statistics encompass many of the commonly-used prediction performance metrics such as accuracy or mean squared error. Howso also includes tools to condition the statistics for detailed analyses between subgroups. An understanding of how your dataset's predictability changes under a variety of conditions provides out of the box insights on your data without the need to build multiple machine learning models.\n",

MAE also appears for nominal values, however they are a form of weighted accuracy using [categorical action probabilities](https://docs.howso.com/en/release-latest/getting_started/terminology.html#categorical-action-probabilities).

Similar to context features and action featuers, the context set is the set queried to make predictions and the action set is the set that the predictions are made for. In other words, the data from the context set is the known information you are using to make a prediction and the action set is unknown information you are trying to predict.\n",

After each case from the action set is predicted, the case is returned to the context set, making it available to be queried for other predictions.\n",
